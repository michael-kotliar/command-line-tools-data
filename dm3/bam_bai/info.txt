Coordinate sorted BAM alignment and BAI index files with 94 mapped paired-end reads from chr4 dm3.
Mapped with STAR from ../fastq/first.fastq.gz and ../fastq/second.fastq.gz input files and indices built to include only chr4 dm3.

Mapping parameters:
    --outFilterMultimapNmax 1  (max number of multiple alignments allowed for a read)
    --outFilterMismatchNmax 5  (maximum number of mismatches per pair)
    --seedSearchStartLmax  15  (defines the search start point through the read)
    --alignSJDBoverhangMin  1  (minimum overhang (i.e. block size) for annotated (sjdb) spliced alignments)
